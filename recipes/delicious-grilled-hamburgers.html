    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Seasoned salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, and garlic powder in a medium bowl; lightly mix until just combined. With minimal handling, form mixture into three patties. Brush oil onto both sides of each patty, then season with salt. </li>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </li>
